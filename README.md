# Variational assimilation of Geophysical images leveraging deep learning tools #

<p> Many applications in Earth Sciences require the estimation of a physical system state. Data assimilation provides a strong framework to do so when knowledge about the governing dynamics and observations of such system are available. If this kind of inverse problem is solved in a variational form, the optimization process involves the adjoint state method for efficient gradient computing. From a computational perspective, this method is equivalent to the backpropagation algorithm and is here implemented using automatic differentiation. The ongoing development of deep learning tools allows flexible implementation of such methods and opens the door to hybrid data-knowledge driven modeling. This is illustrated on geophysical images assimilation problems.
